### Elementary Applied Topology
The course is based on a book of Robert Ghrist,
a pleasant 250-page walk with vistas
to many applications of basic topological ideas, concepts and theorems,
that are also immensely useful in pure mathematics.

#### Syllabus
Manifolds. Complexes. Euler Characteristic. Homology. Sequences. Cohomology. Morse Theory. Homotopy. Sheaves. Categorification.

#### Bibliography
R. Ghrist, "Elementary Applied Topology", ed. 1.0, Createspace, 2014.
ISBN 978-1502880857, Sept. 2014.
Each individual PDF chapter is available for free for personal use at author's website <https://www2.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/notes.html>

#### Grading
Depending on student's track (pure of applied mathematician, or a scientist interested in applying math) the grade can be assigned after an applied project,
or a presentation, or solving some problems, or combination.

#### Contents
The class will choose some of the dozens topics of the book.
For every one of 10 main themes
we will discuss the basic concepts
and some application,
plus what will be required by book's internal logic.

_Pre-requisites_ of point-set topology (p. 238-239) and algebra (p. 240-241)
are introduced in an appendix "Background" - 2 pages each.
Utility and natural appearance of algebraic structures
shall surface in the process of reading the book.

some of the students to invest in rigorous study
of the foundations of topology (with proofs and computations):
