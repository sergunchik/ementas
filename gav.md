### Geometry of Algebraic Varieties.

#### Time and place:

DMAT PUC-Rio, 2024.2 (from August to December),
**Tuesdays** and **Thursdays** from **15h to 17h.**

_In principle, it is possible to gather not on Thursday,
but on Friday morning (before 13h), let me know if this is preferred option._

#### Target audience: 

Students that already have been introduced (at least minimally) 
either to [Algebraic Geometry](ag-en.md) (e.g. MAT2255)
or to [Complex Geometry](complex.md) (e.g. MAT2256).

Students that only had advanced [Riemann Surfaces](rs-en.md) (such as MAT2816)
or Algebraic Curves, or basic [Projective Geometry](pg.md)
may nevertheless try at their own risk:
there are plenty of good problems about algebraic curves that they can choose to solve,
but they may have difficulties in appreciating other students' solutions 
to problems of higher dimension.


#### Plan of the course

Every student in the beginning of the course is assigned personalized set of 10-30 problems
to solve and explain to others during the semester. Solutions of problems shall take at
least half of the time, with formulations and necessary explanations or background taking the rest.

#### Bibliography (suggest yours)

Two main references with exercises for algebraic and complex geometry used to be

1. Robin Hartshorne: Algebraic Geometry
2. Philippe Griffiths and Joe Harris: Principles of Algebraic Geometry

In particular, it is a well-known feature of Hartshorne's textbook that some important
parts of the theory are delegated to exercises, so students who skipped them might not
digested the theory.

Problems from other textbooks, such as 

- Huybrechts "Complex Geometry",
- Voisin "Hodge theory and complex geometry", 
- Vakil "The Rising Sea: Foundations of Algebraic Geometry",
- Liu "Introduction to algebraic and arithmetic geometry", 
- Mukai "Introduction to invariants and moduli",
- Shafarevich "Basic algebraic geometry",
- Harris "Algebraic geometry: start up course",

and more specialized books as 

- Beauville "Algebraic surfaces", 
- Mumford "Abelian varieties", 

based on students' background and intentions.
