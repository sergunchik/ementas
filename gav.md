### Geometry of Algebraic Varieties.

#### proposed for 2024.2

#### Target audience: 

Students that already have been introduced (at least minimally) 
either
to [Algebraic Geometry](ag-en.md) (e.g. MAT2255)
or [Complex Geometry](complex.md) (e.g. MAT2256).

Students that only had advanced [Riemann Surfaces](rs-en.md) (such as MAT2816)
or Algebraic Curves, or basic [Projective Geometry](pg.md)
may nevertheless try at their own risk:
there are plenty of good problems about algebraic curves that they can choose to solve,
but they may have difficulties in appreciating other students' solutions 
to problems of higher dimension.


#### Plan of the course

Every student in the beginning of the course is assigned personalized set of problems
to solve and explain to others during the semester. Solutions of problems shall take at
least half of the time, with formulations and necessary explanations or background taking the rest.
