Prefaces.

Shafarevich:
> This book is a general introduction to algebraic geometry. Its aim is
a treatment of the subject as a whole, including the widest possible spectrum
of topics... The nature of the book requires the algebraic apparatus to be kept
to a minimum. In addition to an undergraduate algebra course, we assume known
basic material from field theory: finite and transcendental extensions (but not
Galois theory), and from ring theory: ideals and quotient rings.

Kempf: 
> Algebraic geometry is a mixture of the ideas of two Mediterranean
cultures. It is the superposition of the Arab science of the lightning
calculation of the solutions of equations over the Greek art of position and
shape. This tapestry was originally woven on European soil and is still being
refined under the influence of international fashion. Algebraic geometry
studies the delicate balance between the geometrically plausible and the
algebraically possible. Whenever one side of this mathematical teeter totter
outweighs the other, one immediately loses interest and runs off in search of
a more exciting amusement... In this book we present from a modern point of
view the basic theory of algebraic varieties and their coherent cohomology. The
local part of the study includes dimension and smoothness. I have tried to keep
the commutative algebra down to minimum while putting the geometry close to the
algebra as part of the exposition. The basic tools in algebraic geometry are
sheaves and their cohomology. This material is presented from the beginning.
I have included the basic discussion of curves to illustrate the theory... The
main battle was to teach the reader to think globally in sheaf theoretic
language.
