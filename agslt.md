# Algebraic Geometry and Statistical Learning

On one hand we will introduce the basics of statistical machine learning, and on the other
the basics of algebraic geometry and singularity theory, employed by author
to study singular statistical models (and all real world models are singular).
In the course we read the book [1] of Sumio Watanabe, whose contents are:

1. [1-47] **Introduction.**
Basic concepts in statistical learning.
Statistical models and learning machines.
Statistical estimation methods.
Four main formulas.
Overview.
Probability theory.
2. [48-76] **Singularity theory.**
Polynomials and analytic functions.
Algebraic set and analytic set.
Singularity.
Resolution of singularities.
Normal crossing singularities.
Manifold.
3. [77-104] **Algebraic geometry.**
Ring and ideal.
Real algebraic set.
Singularities and dimension.
Real projective space.
Blow-up.
Examples.
4. [105-132] **Zeta function and singular integral.**
Schwartz distribution.
State density function.
Mellin transform.
Evaluation of singular integral.
Asymptotic expansion and b-function.
5. [133-157] **Empirical processes.**
Convergence in law.
Function-valued analytic functions.
Empirical process.
Fluctuation of Gaussian processes.
6. [158-216] **Singular learning theory.**

7. [217-248] **Singular learning machines.**
Learning coefficient.
Three-layered neural networks.
Mixture models.
Bayesian network.

Bias and variance.
Non-analytic learning machines.
8. [249-276] **Singular statistics.**

Widely applicable information criteria.
Singular hypothesis test.
Realization of a posteriori distribution.
From regular to singular.

_Pre-requisites_ (citing the author):

> This book involves several mathematical fields, for example, singularity theory, algebraic geometry, Schwartz distribution, and empirical processes. However, these mathematical concepts are introduced in each chapter for those who are unfamiliar with them. No specialized mathematical knowledge is necessary to read this book. The only thing the reader needs is _a mathematical mind seeking to understand the real world._
